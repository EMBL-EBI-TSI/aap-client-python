Overview
########

This library can be used to interface with the AAP, although it is also able to sign tokens.
(for testing the verification is done correctly)

Cryptographic files here shouldn't be used in production, they're just for testing :)

``$ pip install -r requirements.txt``

for testing, the testing dependencies also need to be installed:

``pip install -e .[test]``

Usage
#####
